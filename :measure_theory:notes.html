					<h2>1. Topological Preliminaries</h2>
						<p>Like the title suggests, this chapter includes the topological concepts I believe are necessary to measure theory and probability. The topics are developed based on Munkres' Topology and RCA. </p>
						<p>I focus more on the countabiilty and separation axioms than most measure theory texts; second countability in particular I found to be a key property that connects topologies and Borel sigma-algebras. 
						</p>
						<p>I also present three different versions of Urysohn's lemma. The first is the one found in RCA, which assumes the underlying topological space is locally compact Hausdorff and thus requires the closed set involved to be compact. Urysohn's lemma for normal spaces is more general in that it holds for any closed set, since normal spaces are special cases of locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Lastly, restricting the underlying space to a metrizable space even allows us to construct a Lipschitz continuous Urysohn function, which is particularly useful when proving the Portmanteau theorem later on. 
						</p>
						<p>While it is not a topological topic, I conclude the chapter with a discussion of subsequences and limits superior/inferior. I have yet to see a satisfactorily comprehensive treatment of these core concepts of analysis, even in PMA, so I decided to include my own treatise on the subject here.
